## PowerUp.ps1

This is a tool that performs local priviledge escalation. It is a pure PowerShell script, and therefore has better chances of running compared to BeRoot.

To run PowerUp, launch Powershell and type:

``Import-Module .\PowerUp.ps1`` Then type ``R`` to run the script once. 

To perform all checks on the system, run the following:

``Invoke-AllChecks``
